# Pockemon card generator app
# Description
Welcome to our project! In this project, we are going to create a random pokemon card generator. For this, we used HTML, CSS and Javascript. Apart from this, we also be using the poke API to get the necessary data.
The poke Card generator consists of a button called – ‘Generate’. When the user clicks on this button a card is displayed with a random pokemon name, image and other stats.
